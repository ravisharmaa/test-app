## About This Repo

This is made with Laravel and Vue js for Js Framework and Vuex for state management 
and Vue Router. Setup Steps

- `clone this repo`
- `composer install `
- `copy env.example and rename it to .env`
- run `php artisan generate:key` to generate the app key
- due to the project is small so I have used sqlite as my db, I have configured that. in 
`config/database.php` so I believe the setup would be easy
- run `php artisan serve`
- please refer to category branch for category and posts this branch only manages crud of the posts table
- Since i am working on the relation ship with category and posts i will publish it as soon as i finish it.
